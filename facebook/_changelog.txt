0.0.0.4
-------

- Finally reached persistent connection - silent session refresh + periodical reconnect like original web client - although the connection may fall down, restrictive politics will disconnect when any error occurs (mostly server time-out)
- Redesigned session control to fit original web client
- Raised default update loop poll rate to 24 seconds - less traffic, optimal processing load side by side with message loop, which has poll rate of 55 seconds when not active
- Work-around for last protocol change (not receiving status message with periodical updates) by loading mobile profile page to get the data (maybe usable for other user details in future)
- Rewritten update process to request only changes since last check for updates - minimal traffic, noticefuly reduced processing load
- Completely rewritten contacts handling - this solves a) avatar flickering b) updating status, real name and idle flag too often
- Fixed reloading avatar when not needed
- Parsing improvements (solves many issues like buffer overruns/overflows)
- Fixed leak of User-Agent strings
- Better handling of garbage collecting on shutdown
- Possibility to see actual cookies via Options dialog
- Optional toggling of logging (default off)
- Extra icon for "Mind" function
- Light performance improvements in getting data from results
- More sophisticated logging system

0.0.0.3
-------

- Isolated response processings (avoiding crashes)
- Fixed crashes caused by illegal processing of foreign typing notifications
- Added a response validation & logout mechanism which safely closes connection and threads on disconnection/logout
- Removed Away status, inactivity is controlled by server as Idle
- Raised minimal poll rate to 10 seconds (interval of updating contact list)
- Removed some unneeded code
- Added an option to change user-agent (if FB would ever like to block us, hahah xD)
- Fixed message server URL "virginity" flag :))

Known issues:

- Login session gets down after some time (should be more than 1 hour), the reason or a way to avoid this is not known to me, yet [FIXED]

0.0.0.2
-------

- Fixed JSON parsing issues, now data change should be OK
- Repaired timestamps for outgoing messages
- Added "Clear" option in Mind dialog (when no Mind status filled in)
- Added Mind status item toggling (hidden when offline, shown otherwise)
- Added safer logout
- Fixed Updater support (I hope :))
- Poll rate customization
- Implemented idle/away, but not working on the server :/
- Improvements in a logging system
- Some code reorganization, mainly making some processing safe
- More pretty code management

Known issues:

- Crash is invoked when receiving typing notification from FB with no message followed in a "packet" (both events use similar format => bad exception for non-message content leading to buffer overrun) [FIXED]
- Plugin doesn't detect when the connection is closed/logged out remotely (rarely, but may happen, may bring some crash) [FIXED]
- Avatars may flicker, their updating process hasn't been optimized, yet [FIXED]

0.0.0.1
-------

- Working avatars
- Improvements to JSON parsing, still needs pretty enhancements
- Introducing smart-like logging
- Many code management changes
- Checked all dialogs validity
- Bringing some basic options to work
- Marked probably almost all memory leaks which should be solved
- Marked some things to take a look on + solution options somewhere
- Managed all TODOs
- Removed some unneeded, deprecated and testing code

Known issues:

- Frequent crashes caused by saving cookies on login and when obtaining updates/messages periodically (parse error) [FIXED]

0.0.0.0

Private initial release

All-time Issues
---------------

- Nothing, yet :)

All-time Not-issues
-------------------

- Status messages are not set properly when you set them to often - server limit requires captcha confirmation when you flood
- Being often disconnected - server fault, trying to find a work-around, but that's not easy - pidgin-facebookchat reports same thing
- Away status as is not applicable, FB doesn't support any active/controllable Away status, only server-driven Idle.
